# HapticsMaxBasics
#
### These are a collection of Max patches/instruments that I've developed for simple spatial rendering using haptic devices, such as voice-coil actuators. 
### I am in the process of cleaning these patches up to make them more user-friendly soon.
### In addition to the patches, I have also included a set of VR Instructions for setting up an HTC Vive to send gestural control data to your patches to adjust the parameters in realtime.

#
## SoundBasics1
##
### This patch helps show the basic relationship between frequency and phase.
#
## SoundBasics2
##
### This patch helps to show the continuity from form, to rhythm, to pitch depending on frequency rate.
### It also helps demo timbre and waveshape using filters on a phasor.
#
## Basics
##
### This patch allows for simple play with frequency and phase in two channels. 
### Frequency beating at low rates (try ~0.2–2 Hz difference around 100 Hz) and phase changes create interesting apparent motion effects when used with an armband with opposing voice-coil actuators on either side of the forearm.
#
## BODYdgeridoo_Additive120_v1
##
### This patch features two timbrally complex additive synthesis tones. 
### I developed this patch to provide more timbral/textural nuance to frequencies when trying to activate different biomechanical resonances/responses in the 1–12 Hz range using a platform for sitting/standing.
### This should work for adding textural nuance in wearble implementations too. 
#
## DBAP_2chPan_cart
##
### This patch features Distance-Based Amplitude Panning between 2 channels. 
# 
## DBAP_4chPan_cart
##
### This patch features Distance-Based Amplitude Panning among 4 channels. Needs a sound card for routing to 4 distinct channels.
# 
## 2ch_ApparentMotion_Switchboard_Simple
##
### This patch should be used in Presentation Mode (button to toggle into this mode at bottom of patcher).
### This is a demo intended to be used with an armband with opposing voice-coil actuators on either side of the forearm. 
### It demos egocentric virtual and perceptual rendering approaches.
### It features three kinds of apparent motion: distance-based amplitude panning, a tactile-kinaesthetic illusion from frequency beating, and a kinaesthetic illusion from phase changes.
